            <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(4)">Is computer science the same as programming?</div>
            <div class="answer" id="answer4">
                Many students are attracted to the Computer Science major because they either like using computers or have enjoyed some prior programming experiences. Computer programming is a broad term covering a range of software development activities, ranging from writing small programs in order to perform simple tasks, to the creation of large user applications and systems software consisting of millions of lines of complex code.

                Programming and programming languages are tools of computer science, but they are not its primary subject matter. There is a reason the major is called Computer Science and not “Computer Programming” since the emphasis is on the best methods for tackling problems whose solutions are not immediately apparent. Complex and abstract problem solving plays a key role in the application of computer technology to practical problems. Before you can effectively build complex and maintainable applications, you must have fundamental knowledge of programming tools, mathematical concepts, and software development methodology. Computer Science goes far beyond merely programming. A bachelor’s degree in computer science qualifies students for jobs as “software engineers,” the most common job title for graduates with computer science degrees. A bachelor’s degree in computer science also teaches students critical time management, problem solving, software engineering, networking, and security skills.

<div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(5)">Is computer science right for me?</div>
            <div class="answer" id="answer5">
                Computer Science is a vital, fun field of study, but it is not for everyone. Because it is such a broad field, your success can depend a great deal on selecting the program of study that best fits your interests. Please read the first two FAQs at the top of the page. If you’re still unsure if Computer Science is right for you, here are two analogies that might help you decide:

                <li>Computer Game Analogy: 1) if you simply like playing computer games, CS is probably not a good fit; 2) if you want to program computers to play games, CS may or may not be a good fit; 3) if you are interested in the theory and practice of making games run quickly, or the precise mathematical techniques for modeling physical objects and processes on the screen, CS is likely to be an excellent fit.</li>
                <li>Car and Driver Analogy: Most people drive cars and even enjoy driving them, but this doesn’t mean they have the ability or talent to build or design automobile engines; likewise people who enjoy using computers may or may not be well-suited to the study of computer science. However, if you wonder how software works and why the designers made the choices that they did, and how to improve upon those choices, computer science is likely to be a good fit.</li>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(6)">What couses should I take in high school, or before I transfer, to prepare me for computer science?</div>
            <div class="answer" id="answer6">
                Take all the science, mathematics, and English you can. Strong mathematics skills are crucial for Computer Science majors, particularly during the first two years. New majors tend to struggle the most with weaknesses related to math. Clear writing is important to computer science since most software is developed by groups of software engineers. Computer scientists devote considerable effort to writing in the form of specification documents, progress reports, user documents, and internal communications arguing the pros and cons of alternative designs and approaches.

            <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(7)">What skills or talents will help me suceed in computer science?</div>
            <div class="answer" id="answer7">
                Useful skills include: strong problem solving skills, logical thinking, community skills (teamwork, group participation), mathematical skills, writing skills, and a willingness to concentrate on precise details for an extended period of time.

            <div class="answer" id="answer9">
                In a recent survey, the average starting salary of our students was much greater than other majors in our college (approximately $78,000 per year). This starting salary even edged-out Computer Engineering average starting salaries, which reflects a growing emphasis on software. Starting salaries can vary depending on a variety of factors, such as company size, location, and the employee’s qualifications.
